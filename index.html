<h1> Project on Console </h1>
<p id="para1">

    Visual studio is a coding app which is mostly used by 
    all the coders as the code of visual studio is very easy to understand
    and it also helps in correcting the coder's mistake at the same time..

</p>
<p id="para2">

    Console is a funtion which is mostly used by all the coders
    as when they script big codes, they do not understand
    where they are going wrong so this Console function
    gives a warning to the coder that at this place your code went wrong.
    The coders understand that their code is checked
    by the console as when the console gives a warning about the mistake,
    it checks all the code behind and then only gives the warning..

<p id="para3">

    To open console, first right click on the previewed screen,
    then select the last option which is INSPECT.
    Then a top tab navigator will open. In that navigator,
    "ELEMENTS" option will be selected by default.
    Besides "ELEMNTS", there will be an option like "CONSOLE".
    Click on that option to see the console.. 
    ** THIS CONSOLE WILL NOT BE VISIBLE ON THE SCREEN **
